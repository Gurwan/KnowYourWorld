  <strong>Know Your World</strong>

<p> The idea of the project is to create a website bringing together different games linking memory and general culture. The project is still under development and for the moment gathers only one game. In its final version, the site will allow to have a user account with which we can keep our scores on each game offered by the platform. </p>

<p>
The first game is called "Countries Game" (see images of the project) and the goal is to find all the countries in the world taking as little time as possible and of course without cheating ! (visual 1) </p>
